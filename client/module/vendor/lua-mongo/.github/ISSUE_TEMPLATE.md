Please note that **lua-mongo** is merely a binding to Mongo C Driver. It neither adds nor subtracts anything within the supported API.

Before reporting an issue, please make sure the problem is with **lua-mongo** itself rather than with MongoDB syntax or the Mongo C Driver API by checking the following links:

[MongoDB operators](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/)

[Mongo C Driver API](http://mongoc.org/libmongoc/current/api.html)

Issues unrelated to **lua-mongo** will be closed without a warning.
